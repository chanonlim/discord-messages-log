# discord-messages-log
A browser-based app to log messages from Discord

# Setup Guide
1. Download and extract the files.
2. Open setter.html in your browser
3. Create a bot account (if you don't have one, if you don't know how, instruction is at https://twentysix26.github.io/Red-Docs/red_guide_bot_accounts/#creating-a-new-bot-account) then put in the bot token (this is NOT the client secret)
4. Invite the bot to your server (https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=[insert your client id]&scope=bot&permissions=0)
5. Put the token in setter.html in the browser and click Submit. If you only want to log messages from a specific channel, put in the channel ID there too.
6. Click "Submit"
7. Open index.html in the same browser that you opened setter.html
8. You're done!

# Note
This was made as a random project so I didn't put a lot of effort into it so it may have bugs and the instruction may not be clear for you.  
And also it doesn't redraw edits.
